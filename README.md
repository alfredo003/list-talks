# My React To-Do List Project
This is my React.js study project where I created a to-do list application. It has been a fun and challenging experience exploring React concepts such as using useState and creating components.

Technologies Used
React.js

Features
- Add tasks to the list

- Delete tasks from the list

Motivation
As a backend developer, I decided to expand my knowledge in frontend development and chose React.js as one of the technologies to learn. Creating this to-do list was an initial step to become familiar with React concepts and techniques.

It has been enjoyable to discover how to create reusable components and utilize component state with useState. This experience has shown me the importance of understanding and exploring different areas of development, enriching my perspective as a developer.

Next Steps
- Enhance the application interface
- Implement task editing functionality
- Add user authentication
